Created by pulling a subdirectory out of [https://github.com/josephks/lift_24_sbt](https://github.com/josephks/lift_24_sbt)

Clone this repo to get a base you can build your Lift based webapp on.

Run ```./sbt``` to run sbt.  If you get a failed download message try removing your ```~/.ivy2``` directory.

To get a war file use the "package-war" command, not the "package" command.
